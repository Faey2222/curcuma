Curcuma UI is a modern scalable and modular object oriented CSS framework in early development. The goal is to create a lightweight framework with only those components really used in most websites and webapps. 

**Therefore Curcuma UI won't support any legacy browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 or lower**.


## Early Development
Please keep in mind that, as mentioned before, Curcuma UI is in a very early state of development and is **currently not intended to be used in a productive environment**. Furthermore during alpha development you may reckon that there will be some inevitable breaking changes.
